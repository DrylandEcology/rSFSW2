    #  - "linear" (i.e., using Boe et al.'s correction) resulted for the

    #     p. 6: "... values that are outside the observed quantile map (e.g. in
    #     the early parts of the 20th century) are interpolated using standard
    #     anomalies (i.e. number of standard deviations from the mean)
    #     calculated for observed data and GCM data. Although this approach
    #     ostensibly assumes a normal distribution, it was found during testing
    #     to be much more stable than attempts to use more sophisticated
    #     approaches. In particular, the use of Extreme Value Type I or
    #     Generalized Extreme Value distributions for extending the tail of the
    #     probability distributions were both found to be highly unstable in
    #     practice and introduced unacceptable daily extremes in isolated grid
    #     cells. These errors occur because of irregularities in the shapes
    #     of the CDFs for observed and GCM data, which relates in part to the
    #     relatively small sample size used to construct the monthly CDFs
    #     (i.e. n = 30)."
