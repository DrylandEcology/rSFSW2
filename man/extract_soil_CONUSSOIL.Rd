\description{
\var{\sQuote{CONUS-SOIL}} is a rasterized and controlled
\var{\sQuote{STATSGO}} dataset; information for 11 soil are layers available.
}
\section{Note}{
 It appears that \var{NODATA} values are recorded as 0s.

 We convert what \var{\sQuote{CONUS-SOIL}} calls
  \var{\dQuote{bulk density}} to matric density with equation 20 from
  Saxton et al. 2006: \eqn{bulkd = matricd * (1 - rockvol) + rockvol * 2.65}
  If this variable is indeed \var{\dQuote{bulk density}}, then equation 20
  (Saxton et al. 2006) would give negative values
