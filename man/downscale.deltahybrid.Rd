}
\arguments{
\item{obs.hist.daily}{A list. Each element corresponds to one year of
\code{simstartyr:endyr} is an object of
\code{\link[rSOILWAT2:swWeatherData-class]{rSOILWAT2::swWeatherData}}.}

\item{obs.hist.monthly}{A numeric matrix. Monthly time-series of observed weather
calculated from \code{obs.hist.daily} for the years \code{simstartyr:endyr}.}

\item{scen.hist.monthly}{A numeric matrix. Monthly time-series of scenario weather
during the historic time period \code{DScur_startyr:DScur_endyr}}

\item{scen.fut.monthly}{A numeric matrix. Monthly time-series of scenario weather
during the projected time period \code{DSfut_startyr:DSfut_endyr}}

\item{opt_DS}{A named list.}

\item{do_checks}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE} perform several sanity checks on the
data.}
