\title{\pkg{rSFSW2}: Framework for \pkg{rSOILWAT2} simulations: creating simulation
 runs, executing simulations, and aggregating outputs}
\description{
Setting up, carrying out, and analyzing ecosystem water balance simulation experiments with SOILWAT2.
}
\section{FORCING}{
 \pkg{SOILWAT2} is forced by \itemize{
   \item daily time traces: \itemize{
           \item rainfall (cm)
           \item minimum air temperature at 2-m height (C)
           \item maximum air temperature at 2-m height (C)
         }
   \item mean monthly values (climate normals): \itemize{
           \item wind speed at 2-m height (miles/h before \pkg{SOILWAT} v24;
                 m/s starting with \pkg{SOILWAT} v24)
           \item relative humidity at 2-m height (\%)
           \item cloud cover (\%)
         }
   \item mean vegetation
   \item soil characterization
   \item et cetera
 }
