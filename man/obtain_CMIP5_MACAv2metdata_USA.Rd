\title{Check and prepare local copy of aggregated \var{CMIP5_MACAv2metdata} dataset}
\usage{
obtain_CMIP5_MACAv2metdata_USA(locations, dir_ex_fut)
}
\arguments{
\item{locations}{A data frame. Two columns \code{X_WGS84} and
\code{Y_WGS84} of locations describe rectangle
for which data will be downloaded.}

\item{dir_ex_fut}{A character string. The path name to future climate
projections.}
}
\value{
If all files are available, then a message is printed to the
 R console with that information. Otherwise, the message points to a
 \var{.sh} script that was created at the
 \code{MACAv2metdata_USA} sub-folder. This script must be run
 separately to download the missing files.

Check and prepare local copy of aggregated \var{CMIP5_MACAv2metdata} dataset
}
\section{Notes}{
 The download scripts use \var{wget}, i.e., it must be
  available on your system to work. The scripts are based on the dataset
  repository setup at
  \url{https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/index.php} as of
  Dec 2019. This dataset has been bias corrected against \var{gridMET}.
