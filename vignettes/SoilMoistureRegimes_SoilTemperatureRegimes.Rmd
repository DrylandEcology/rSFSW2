This vignette explains how SWSF has implemented the calculations of soil moisture regime (SMR) and soil temperature regime (STR) and compares the logic with the Java Newhall Simulation Model and with the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

## Notes
* Quoted text is directly from [SSS 2014](#SSS2014).  So direction of a logic may be opposite of a condition, which will be indicated by \! before the condition.
* jNSM calculations can be found at end of this document. Line numbers refer to file 'BASICSimulationModel.java'

## Soil Moisture Regimes

### Undefined
* SWSF
    * not one of {[perudic](#perudic), [aridic](#aridic), [xeric](#xeric), [ustic](#ustic), [udic](#udic), [anhydrous](#anhydrous)}
* [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016) (line 3060)
    * not one of {[perudic](#perudic), [aridic](#aridic), [xeric](#xeric), [ustic](#ustic), [udic](#udic)}


### Perudic
* Regime characteristic of areas where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration every month
* SWSF
    * [COND0](#COND0)
* [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016) (lines 2977ff)
    * perudic: [[COND0](#COND0)] swt != 0
* Characteristics ([SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
    * [[COND0](#COND0)] precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years
    * the moisture tension rarely reaches 100 kPa in the soil moisture control section
* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * The soil is almost always moist; soil tension is rarely > 100 kPa (about >1 bar)
    * Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration by plants in every month.
* Remarks
    * Somewhat unclear if PET or AET should be compared with PPT. "evapotranspiration by plants" sounds like AET, but jNSM uses PET. SWSF follows jNSM and uses PET.


### Udic
* Regime characteristic of humid regions with seasonally well distributed precipitation

    + "except for short periods, a three- phase system, solid-liquid-gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 C"
* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * Soil is dry < 90 cumulative days in most years
    * Soil is dry < 45 consecutive days in summer and early fall (except in very warm areas and locations where there is little difference between summer and winter soil temperatures).

    * jNSM ignores [COND4](#COND4), [COND5](#COND5), and [COND6](#COND6)
    * SWSF and jNSM ignore "except for short periods, a three- phase system, solid-liquid-gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 C"

## Soil Temperature Regimes
We currently ignore the 'iso-' prefix, i.e., "the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 oC at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower", which is applicable to [frigid](#Frigid), [mesic](#Mesic), [thermic](#Thermic), and [hyperthermic](#Hyperthermic) regimes ([SSS 2014](#SSS2014))

## jNSM variables
#### Code interpretation based on 'BASICSimulationModel.java' and ' NewhallResults.java'

* swt = comparison monthly PET vs. PPT
    * [lines 363-369] noMpeGreaterThanPrecip = \!all(mpe[1:12] > precip[1:12])
    * [lines 370-373] swt =  __IF__ (noMpeGreaterThanPrecip) -1  __ELSE__ 0
* nd with
  nd[1] = numCumulativeDaysDry = [assumption] MCS is dry in ALL layers (cf. COND10)
  nd[2] = numCumulativeDaysMoistDry
  nd[3] = numCumulativeDaysMoist
  nd[1] + nd[2]: test variable for [[COND3](#COND3)]
    * [lines ...]
* dif = absolute difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature (cf. [COND5](#COND5))
    * [lines 199-212] st = mean(temperature[6:8]) + fc
      wt = mean(temperature[c(1:2, 12)]) + fc
       __IF__ (southern hemisphere) swap st and wt
    * [lines 241-215] cs = abs(st - wt) * (1 - fcd) / 2
    * [lines 246-248] dif = (st - cs) - (wt + cs)
* nccm = moistDaysAfterWinterSolstice = [assumption] CONSECUTIVE days in the 4 months following the winter solstice when MCS is moist in ALL layers (cf. [COND9](#COND9))
    * [lines 2147, 2171, 2173, 2209, 2211, 2246, 2247]
    * [line 2252] nccm = max
* nccd = dryDaysAfterSummerSolstice = [assumption] CONSECUTIVE days in the 4 months following the summer solstice when MCS is dry in ALL layers (cf. [COND6](#COND6))
    * [lines 2029, 2053, 2055, 2091, 2093, 2128, 2129]
    * [line 2134] nccd = max
* ncpm with
  ncpm[1] = numConsecutiveDaysMoistInSomeParts
  ncpm[2] = numConsecutiveDaysMoistInSomePartsOver8C [assumption] CONSECUTIVE days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50cm is above 8C and MCS is moist in ANY layers (cf. [COND2](#COND2))
    * [lines ...]
* nsd with
  nsd[1] = numCumulativeDaysDryOver5C [assumption] cumulative days when MCS is dry in all parts and the soil temperature at a depth of 50cm is above 5C (cf. [COND1](#COND1))
  nsd[2] = numCumulativeDaysMoistDryOver5C
  nsd[3] = numCumulativeDaysMoistOver5C
    * [lines 1487, 1536, 1563]
* tma = mean annual soil temperature
    * [lines 193-196] sumt = sum(temperature[1:12])
    * [line 198] tma = mean(sumt) + fc
* lt5c = [assumption] cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is above 5 C (cf. [COND1](#COND1))
    * [lines 1483, 1451, 1565]
* Remarks
    * dif
        * jNSM is using the old limit of 5 C instead of the new limit of 6 C
        * "in 1999 the Iso- definitions were refined from < 5 degrees C to < 6 degrees C" [slide 3 of ' jNSM_Background_Use_Tutorial.pptx']
        * SWSF is using new limit of 6 C


#### jNSM inputs

* precip[1:12] = monthly precipitation in mm
* temperature[1:12] = mean monthly air temperature in C
* mpe[1:12] = monthly potential evaporation in mm based on Thornthwaite 1948
* fc = 2.5 = Degree offset between soil and air temperature in Celsius [Comment: this value is being applied in the code to both monthly and annual data]
* fcd = 0.66 = Soil-Air Relationship Amplitude
